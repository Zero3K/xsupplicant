In order for Xsupplicant to be able to use the network cards, a protocol
handler is required.  Since Microsoft includes a sample protocol handler
in their DDK that will work, it seemed there was no reason to reinvent the
wheel.  Instead, I have opted to include a binary version in CVS, and a
patch file that can be applied to the DDK code to create the version needed
for Xsupplicant.

The reason that the entire source for the protocol handler is not included is
because the license for the Microsoft DDK only allows object code to be
redistributed.  So, by providing a binary version, and a patch to create the
source version, we are in compliance with the license requirements set forth
by Microsoft.  At the same time, we are providing a way for people to do
work on the driver component, if they wish to do so.

The patch file is created using WinMerge. (http://www.winmerge.org)
