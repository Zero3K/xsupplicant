Version 1.3.1
	- Implemented new EAP state machine as defined by RFCs 3748/4137.
	- Updated EAP methods to match the requirements of the new EAP
	  state machine.
	- Begin adding support for using GNU-TLS for the TLS engine instead of
	  OpenSSL. 
	- Moved the ias_quirk option to the EAP-MSCHAPv2 where it really
	  belonged.
	- Added support for EAP-FAST.
	- Added support for Mac OS X.

Version 1.2.8
	- Fixed a problem that kept wired authentication from working.
	- Fixed an issue that would cause authentication to be slow.
	- Fixed a bug that would prevent some Linux OS versions from compiling.
	- Misc. other fixes
	- Updated documentation to show that iwlib is required on Linux.
	- Added the ability to associate using methods other than 'open system'.

Version 1.2.7
	- Added a copy of the latest wireless.h for Linux, so we no longer have
	  to worry about missing #ifdefs when writing wext version specific
	  code.
	- Added interface operational state setting following successful or
	  failed authentication.  Using a DHCP client that supports this will
	  allow Xsupplicant to notify it that it needs to get/renew an 
	  address.
	- Fixed some endianness problems with WPA/WPA2 IEs where 16 bit values
	  were used.

Version 1.2.6
	- As promised, the madwifi specific driver code is now gone.  Madwifi
	  users should use the regular wireless extensions calls from now
  	  on.
	- Added support for TTLS-EAP-MD5
	- Fixed a bug from 1.2.5 that caused a segfault when a reauthentication
	  took place.
	- Clean up some memory leaks.
	- Clean up some potential buffer overflows.

Version 1.2.5
	- Fixed PEAP so that it handles getting a success inside of the
	  TLS tunnel.  PEAP now works correctly with Funk SBR.
	- Fixed up madwifi driver so that it shouldn't cause compiler problems
	  when IOCTLs get renamed/changed around.
	- Added driver capabilities support for madwifi driver.
	- Fixed WPA2 support for madwifi driver.
	- Added initial TNC support via patch from Mike McCauley.  (Requires
          libtnc to work.)
	- Fixed a crash under certain circumstances when the SSID name was 
          NULL.  (Such as non broadcast SSID names with certain drivers.)
	- Changed the core event handling system to make things a little 
	  faster, and to suck less CPU time.
	- Fixed a bug in WPA/WPA2 that would often cause the 4 way handshake
	  to fail.  (Or, when it succeeded, the keys were invalid.)
	- Added status messages so that the user can see that Xsupplicant
	  is doing something.
	- Added the start of a GUI monitor/configuration interface.
	- Removed old OS specific event core functionality.  (There are better 
	  ways to handle such things.)
	- When an SSID is set outside of Xsupplicant, keys and the WPA IE are
	  cleared.  (This may cause a problem if you want to connect to a
	  static WEP enabled SSID.  You may need to set the SSID, then
	  set the key with a second command.)
	- WPA IE information is now cleared from the the interface, so that
	  the interface should behave as expected.

Version 1.2.4
	- On startup, we display the capabilities that a card reports having.
	  This can be used to verify that the driver is behaving in the right
	  way to support associating to WPA/WPA2 networks without configuring
	  encryption methods in the config file.
	- Added the ability to associate to WPA/WPA2 networks without setting
	  "wpa_pairwise_cipher" or "wpa_group_cipher" settings.  (Requires that
	  card driver supports returning of proper encryption capabilities.)
	- Added support for a group cipher type of 0.  This indicates that 
	  the group cipher should be the same as the pairwise cipher.
	- Added support for large scan results.  (Scan results > 8192 bytes,
	  which would be more than 20 SSIDs on most cards.)
	- Fixed setting BSSID and clearing keys on some cards.
	- Numerous fixes and updates to WPA2/IEEE 802.11i code.
	- BSSID is now selected using signal strength/quality information 
	  returned during a scan.
	- Added option to enable firmware based roaming.  (Current default is 
	  for firmware to make roaming decisions.  Will probably change in the 
	  future.)
	- We can now use EAP hints included in the Request Identity messages
	  to determine the network we are on.  This can be helpful for wired
 	  networks that don't have an SSID to key the configuration from.
	- Fixes to EAP-AKA implementation to correctly support resync.
