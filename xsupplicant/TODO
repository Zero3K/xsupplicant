Things to do (for some future release -- in no specific order):
- Add software based roaming.  (Passive scanning, etc.) - Figure out passive 
  scanning semantics, and actually use the decision that is made.
- Add a timer that keeps us from making a new association decision for some 
  period of time, when an ESSID set happens outside Xsupplicant.  (Linux)
- Allow building without wireless on Linux
- Allow building with only specific EAP methods.
- When we get an unsolicited scan complete event, look at the new scan data, 
  and decide if there is a better choice. (Linux)
- Remove requirement for OpenSSL, so that a GNU-TLS enabled version doesn't
  require both.
- Add better checking for GNU-TLS with --enable-gnutls autoconf option.
- Fix EAP-TNC with TTLS phase 2 methods other than EAP.
- Add tls_funcs_get_keyblock_len to GNUTLS code.
- Add TLS_FUNCS_CLIENT/SERVER_FIRST functionality to GNUTLS code.
- Fix key generation in EAP-MSCHAPv2 so that it can generate 'normal' keys
     in addition to EAP-FAST keys.
- Store funky EAP-FAST data in something that isn't a variable.  (See comment
     above eapmschapv2_set_challenges().
- Add to EAP-FAST, config check code, config write code, server trusted root capabilitites
- Find all XXX sections in the code, and fix them.
- Drop privs.
- Have config parser do some basic checks to see if files exist, and settings are sane.
- Make "statemachine" and "eap_state" not pointers. (There is no need for them to be.)
- Add scan complete event to Linux and Mac OS X code.

Things to do (for 1.3.1 release) :
- Catch 'Bad Certificate' alert, and restart provisioning for EAP-FAST.  (Use SSL_set_info_callback()?)
- Test all EAP types while running valgrind.
- Deprecate the use of "Username".  If a method is used as a phase 2 method the inner username should be specified with an "Inner_ID", otherwise, it should be specified by an "Identity".
	- EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA will need special treatment to deal with getting the IMSI off the card.
	- *** Should be mostly done.  Need to finish AKA, and SIM.
- Association Timeout doesn't do anything on the Mac.  (Probably due to improper wireless state machine transitions.)
- Figure out why some Linux wireless extensions IOCTLs don't seem to work right on some cards.
- Use of "\" in authentication ID fails on MS-CHAPv2.
- Fix "ONEDOWN" option for Linux.
- Fix "DONT_USE_TEMP" option for Linux.
- Check to be sure that the key handshake completes following an authentication.  Notify the user if it doesn't.


802.11i stuff (to check on often, and implement as time/need permits) :
- Modify to support section 5.4.3.2  (deauth) (done?)
- Implement key state machine 8.5.6
- Preauthentication

Things to check often :
- Disassociates use valid reasons from cardif.h.

Pre-release checklist :
- Update version # in configure.in.
- Verify that example configs are up-to-date.
