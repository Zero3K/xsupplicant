<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>XSupplicant is an 802.1X supplicant and wireless manager developed by the
Open1X group for multiple operating systems.  It supports many authentication
 and encryption methods that are in use on networks today.</p>

<p>In early 2007, the Open1X group became one of the founding members, and
initial projects of, the OpenSEA Alliance.  Please see 
http://www.openseaalliance.com for more information on the OpenSEA alliance.
</p>

<h1>Using XSupplicant</h1>

<p>All of the controls for XSupplicant can be found via the OpenSEA icon that
is found in your tray.  Right clicking this icon will bring up a menu that
allows you to login to networks, configure the supplicant, view log information
or other operations.</p>
<br>



<h2>Connecting to the Network</h2>
<p>In order to connect to a network, you must first have one configured.
Please see the network configuration section for more information on how to
configure a network.</p>

<p>Once you have a network connection defined, you can right click on the
OpenSEA icon in your tray, and select "Login..." to being the login process.
If you are already connected to a network via any of your interfaces, you will
find that the login window will take you directly to a status screen indicating
various pieces of information about your current connection.  If you are not
currently connected to a network, you will be taken to the initial login
window.</p>

<p>If you are taken to the status screen, there are a couple of different
operations that can be taken.  If you have more than one interface in your
machine, you can select a different connection that uses that interface, and
establish a second 802.1X connection by logging in.  At any time, if you
select a connection that is currently connected you will be taken to the status
screen.</p>

<p>If you are taken to the login screen, you will notice that the first
connection (alphabetically) will be selected in the "Connection" drop-down
box.  You should select the connection you want to use from this drop-down
box, enter any information that is requested, and click connect to connect
to that network.</p>
<br>

<h2>Disconnecting from the Network</h2>

<p>To disconnect from a network, right click on the OpenSEA icon in your tray
 and select "Login...".   From the login window, select the connection you
 want to disconnect from via the "Connection" drop-down box near the top of
 the login window.  If this connection is currently connected, you will be
 presented with a status window indicating the current state of the connected
 interface.  At the bottom left corner of the login window will be a button
 labeled "Disconnect".   Clicking this button will cause the supplicant to
 disconnect from the network, and return you to the login prompt.</p>
 <br>





<h1><a name="xsupconfigwindow" id="xsupconfigwindow"></a>Configuring XSupplicant</h1>
<p>There are two ways to get to the configuration window.  The first is to
right-click on the OpenSEA icon in your tray, and select "Configure...".
 The second is to click on the "Configure" button located at the bottom of
 the login window.  Both methods will take you to the same configuration
 window.

<p>The configuration window is divided in to two pieces.  On the left is
 a tree that contains all of your Connections, Profiles, Trusted Servers,
 Globals, and Advanced settings.  Expanding any of those options will
 show you information about the current configuration of the supplicant.
 On the right is where you will edit the configuration options that are
 available for the selected type.</p>

<p>Note : The Globals and Advanced sections have a static set of options
 below them.  The Connections, Profiles, and Trusted Servers will have
 everything that you have configured for that type under them.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupconnmain" id="xsupconnmain"></a>Connections List</h2>
<p>Expanding the connections list on the left side of the configuration window
 will display all of the configurations that you currently have configured.  If
 you don't have any connections configured, you can select the "Connections"
 item from the list, and click on the "New" button located at the bottom of
 the left section, to create a new connection.
</p>

<p>Selecting, or creating, a connection will change the display on the right
 side of the window, and show all of the configuration options that are
 available to you.  At the top of the Connections section, you will see a
 "Connection Name".  The connection name should be set to something that you
 can use to identify this network connection.  As an example, if you are
 setting up a connection to use on a WPA-PSK network in your house you might
 want to name the connection "House WPA-PSK Network".</p>

<p>Below the Connection name is a series of tabs.  Each tab configures a
different aspect of the connection that is being used.</p>




<a name="xsupadapter" id="xsupadapter"></a>
<h2><a name="xsupconnections" id="xsupconnections"></a>Connections: Adapter Tab</h2>
<p>The first tab that you will come to is the adapter tab.  The adapter
tab allows you to select the network adapter that you want to use with this
connection.  By selecting an adapter from the "Adapter :" drop-down box, the
contents of the window below it may change.  There are two different
display sets that you can see in the adapter tab depending on if the adapter
is a wireless adapter, or a wired adapter.
</p>

<h2>Connections: Adapter Tab (Wired)</h2>
<p>If the adapter that you have selected from the "Adapter" drop-down is a
 wired adapter, you will be presented with a fairly simple set of options.
 For wired adapters you need only specify the 802.1X profile that you want
 to use to authenticate this connection.  By default there is no profile
 set.  If you do not have any profiles configured you need to do that and
 then come back and set the profile for the connection configuration.
 Failure to set a profile will result in the connection not being usable to
 connect to your network.</p>

<h2>Connections: Adapter Tab (Wireless)</h2>
<p>If the adapter that you have selected from the "Adapter" drop-down is a
 wireless adapter, you will be presented with two different panes in the tab.</p>

 <p>
 The first pane, titled "Wireless Network" is used to select the Service
 Set Identifier (SSID) that is used to identify the wireless network you want
 to configure.   If the SSID is broadcast, then you should be able to select
 it from the drop-down box to the left of the "Broadcast" radio button.  If
 the network you are looking for is not in that list, you can click the
 "Rescan" button to have your computer search for any networks it may not have
 found yet.</p>

 <p>If your network is a hidden network, then you won't be able to find it in
  the scan information provided in the Broadcast drop-down box.  In these
  cases, you should select the "Hidden" radio button, and enter the name of
  the hidden network in the edit box to the left of the radio button.
  </p>

 <p>The second pane, titled "Wireless Association Settings" is where you
  define the type of wireless network that this is.  If you are unsure of how
  the wireless network is configured, you should ask the network administrator
  what settings should be used.  (If you are the network administrator, you
  should consult the manual that came with your wireless equipment.)</p>

  <p>The association mode drop-down is used to select the type of network that
  you are connecting to.  XSupplicant supports all of the common network
  association methods that most people would use.  Depending on the Association
  Mode selected, the bottom half of the pane will change to display different
  information.</p>

  <p>If you select WPA-Personal (PSK) or WPA2-Personal (PSK) you will be
  presented with the option to enter the pre-shared key that is configured on
  your wireless access point.  This key must be at least 8 characters long,
  although you are encouraged to make it longer.  You are only required to
  store the preshared key in your configuration if you intend to use this
  connection as an automatic connection.  For manual connections you will be
  prompted for the preshared key when you attempt to connect to the network.</p>

  <p>If you select Dynamic WEP 802.1X, WPA Enterprise, or WPA2 Enterprise you
  will be presented with the option to select a Profile from a drop-down box.
  You are required to specify a profile here.  If you do not yet have a profile
  created, you can save the changes you have made so far, create a profile, and
  come back to finish the configuration.  Failure to specify a profile will
  prevent you from being able to connect to this network.</p>

  <p>If you select Static WEP you will be presented with the option to select
  a 40 bit, or 104 bit hexidecimal key.  You should select the key length that
  you are using, and enter your network key in the field provided.</p>

  <p>If you select Open, you will not have to enter any additional information.
  The open setting is used to connect to unencrypted and unauthenticated networks.
  Such as those often found at hotels or coffee shops.</p>

  <p><b><i><u>NOTE :</u> Any traffic sent on an open network can be viewed by
  anyone else near enough to pick up the signal.  (Which may be a longer
  distance than you would think.)  Where possible you should ALWAYS use
  encryption on your wireless networks.  WEP networks (static or dynamic) are a little bit
  more secure than an open network, but even the strongest keys can be cracked
  in a very short period of time.  Where possible you should ALWAYS use a WPA2
  or WPA enabled network for maximum protection of your data!</i></b></p>





<h2><a name="xsupnetwork" id="xsupnetwork"></a>Connections: Network Tab</h2>
<p>The network tab is where you can manage the IP address settings for
 the connection you are editing.  The default value is to "Obtain network
 settings automatically".  When this option is selected, the supplicant will
 ask the operating system to do a DHCP release and then a DHCP renew on the
 first time you authenticate using the connection.</p>

<p>Below the "Obtain network settings automatically" is a checkbox that allows
 you to specify that you want to issue a DHCP renew each time the network
 challenges you for a reauthentication.  In most circumstances you will want
 to leave this box unchecked.  DHCP's default behavior is to attempt to renew
 the IP address when it believes it needs to.  This option is provided for
 situations where the DHCP client may not be acting as desired.</p>

<p>In the connection setting, you also have the option of using a static IP
 address.  If you select this option, then the "Static IP Address Settings"
 section of the tab will become available.  You should populate the IP address,
 netmask, and gateway with the values that you were given by your network
 administrator.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupdns" id="xsupdns"></a>Connections: DNS Tab</h2>
<p>The DNS tab will allow you to set DNS settings for this connection.  You
may select "Obtain DNS settings automatically" if in the Network tab you
have selected "Obtain network settings automatically".  If, in the network tab,
you selected to set a static IP, you will be forced to provide static DNS
settings.</p>

<p>If you select "Use static DNS server settings" (or it is selected for you)
you should populate the Primary setting at a minmum.  You should speak to your
network administrator to determine the proper settings to use.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupprofmain" id="xsupprofmain"></a>Profiles List</h2>
<p>Expanding the profiles selection on the left side of the configuration 
window will display all of the currently configured profiles.  If you don't
have any profiles configured, you can select the "Profiles" item from the
list and click on the "New button located at the bottom of the left section,
to create a new profile.</p>

<p>Selecting, or creating, a profile will change the display on the
right side of the window, and show all of the configuration options that
are available to you.  At the top of the right side window you will see
settings for the "Profile Name" and "Protocol".</p>

<p>The "Profile Name" is a free form string that will uniquely identify
this profile.  The resulting profile name will be displayed in the profile
drop-down boxes located in the connections configuration.  It is
recommended that you use a descriptive profile name such as "Office Profile"
for the 802.1X profile that you use in your office.</p>

<p>The "Protocol" drop-down box at the top of this window indicates that
EAP protocol methods that you can use for this profile.  The EAP protocol
method that is used on your network is selected by your network administrator.
You should contact your network administator to find out which EAP protocol
you should use.</p>




<a name="xsupprotocol" id="xsupprotocol"></a>
<h2><a name="xsupprofiles" id="xsupprofiles"></a>Profiles Panel: Protocol Settings Tab</h2>
<p>Depending on the EAP protocol that you use, there may be a Protocol
Settings tab that is displayed on the right hand side of the configuration
window.</p>

<p>At the top of the Protocol settings tab is settings to configured a
trusted server.  The "Validate Server Certificate" checkbox will enable
the validation of the RADIUS server's certificate during the authentication
process.  Unchecking this box increases the risk that someone could
pretend to be the RADIUS server and gather your username and password
information.  Because of this, you should only disable checking if you
understand the risks.   Below the checkbox, you will find a drop-down box
that you can use to set the trusted server that you want to use.  Trusted
Servers are configured by using the "Trusted Servers" item in the left
side of the configuration dialog.  Although the option is provided to set
the trusted server to "<None>" this option is only a place holder.  If you
do not set a valid trusted server your authentication attempts will fail.</p>

<p>Below the trusted server section there is an area labeled "Outer Identity".
 Some authentication methods will send the username to the server twice.  The
first time (sometimes called the "Phase 1 username", or "Outer Identity") is
sent across the network with no encryption.  Because of this, you can often
send the initial username as "Anonymous".  There are cases where using the
anonymous outer identity will not work.  If the network you are connecting
to makes use of any form of proxy authentication system, you will probably
have to manually enter an identity using the "Use this identity" option.
The other case where the anonymous outer identity may not work is if the
network administrator has disabled this functionality.  If this has been
done, then you should select "Use this identity" and enter your username in
the field provided.  <b>NOTE : <u><i>Using an Anonymous outer identity does
not mean that the network operator does not know who you are!  The server
that is doing authentication will still log your real username since it is
required once an encrypted tunnel has been established.</i></u></b></p>

<p>At the bottom of this tab, there will be a section to configure the
tunneled protocol.  Like the EAP protocol, the tunneled protocol is defined
by your network administartor.  You should contact your network administrator
to determine the proper setting to use here.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupuser" id="xsupuser"></a>Profiles Panel: User Credentials Tab</h2>
<p>The User Credentials tab is where you can decide if you want the
supplicant to store your user credentials for you, or ask you each time
you attempt to connect to the network.  Selecting "Prompt for both username
 and password" will result in none of your credentials being stored.  You
 will need to enter them each time you attempt to use a connection that
 relies on this profile.  If you select "Prompt for password only" then
 you will be required to enter a username in the "Username" field located
 at the bottom of the tab.  When you attempt to use a connection that
 relies on this profile, the username will already be populated, and you
 will be required to enter a valid password.  If you select "Don't prompt
 for anything." then you must enter a username and password in the "Username"
 and "Password" fields at the bottom of the tab. When you use a connection
 that references this profile, the username and password fields will be
 populated for you.</p>






<h2><a name="xsupservermain" id="xsupservermain"></a>Trusted Servers List</h2>
<p>The Trusted Servers section is where you will set up "trusted servers"
 that can be used when configuring a profile.  A "trusted server" consists
 of a few pieces of information that are used to verify that the server you
 are authenticating against is valid.  Configuring a trusted server is
 important to the security of your username and password during the 802.1X
 authentication.</p>

<p>If no trusted servers currently exist, you can select the "Trusted Servers"
 selection from the left panel, and click the "New" button to create a new
 trusted server.  If a trusted server already exists, selecting it's name
 will cause the configuration panel on the right to display the trusted
 server's configuration information.</p>





<h2><a name="xsuptrustedservers" id="xsuptrustedservers"></a>Trusted Servers Editing Panel</h2>
<p>At the top of the trusted servers editing panel is a field where you
 can enter a name for the trusted server.  This name will be displayed in the
 trusted servers drop-down box when you are configuring a profile.  It is a
 good idea to name the trusted server something descriptive such as "Work
 Trusted Server".</p>

<p>The majority of the fields that are shown in the lower part of the trusted
 server configuration panel are informational, and cannot be changed.  They
 will be populated as the result of selecting a root CA certificate by
 clicking the "Browse" button.</p>

<p>If you enable the checkbox for "Verify Common Name" the "Common Name"
 field will become editable.  In the common name field you can enter a
 portion of a DNS domain name that will be matched against the certificate
 that is provided by the server.  This provides an extra measure of security
 for networks were public certificate authorities are in use.  You should
 contact your network administrator to verify if you should enable this
 setting.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupservercert" id="xsupservercert"></a>Trusted Root Certificate Servers Window</h2>
<p>Trusted certificates - text to come</p>





<h2><a name="xsupglobals" id="xsupglobals"></a>Globals Panel</h2>
<p>Main globals - text to come</p>






<h2><a name="xsuplogging" id="xsuplogging"></a>Globals: Logging</h2>
<p>In the current release, the logging selections are fairly simple.  If
 you want to enable logging to a file, check the box marked "Enable
 Logging to a File".  This will make the "Log Directory" and "Log Level"
 selections available for you to change.</p>

<p>The "Log Directory" option is where you specify the directory that you
 want your log files written to.  Selecting the browse button on the right
 will allow you to graphically select the directory that the files should
 be saved to.  <b><i>NOTE:</i></b> The log files will be created with default
 log file names.  There is currently no way to change the name of the log files
 that are written.  By default, two old logs will also be kept in this directory.
 </p>

<p>The "Log Level" option will allow you to determine how detailed the log
 file should be.  Currently, you are presented with three options.  The
 "Normal" log option will show you basic status of the supplicant.  This
 will include things such as authentication successes and failures, interface insertions
 or removals, and any errors encountered during the normal operation of the
 supplicant.   The "Verbose" log option will show you all of the information
 that is included in the "Normal" log level, along with some additional
 information about the supplicant.  This additional information will include
 things such as basic state machine transitions.  In general, you will want
 to use "Normal" mode.</p>

<p>The "Debug" mode of the "Log Level" behaves differently than the other two.
 In debug mode, every possible piece of log data is written to the log file.
 You will only want to use this mode when you have been asked to by an Open1X
 developer or support person.  <b><i>NOTE:</i></b> We make every effort to
 avoid having sensative data in the log files.  However, things such as
 usernames and password hashes used in the authentications WILL be written
 to the log file.  Cleartext versions of passwords should NEVER be written to
 the log files.  However, we suggest that people exercise caution when giving
 anyone a copy of a log file.  You should do a search through the log for
 any information that you consider sensative, and replace it with something
 such as Xs.  If, in your searching, you find something that you believe shouldn't
 be included in the log file, please report it to the project list, or one
 of the project developers so that it can be considered for removal from
 future log files.</p>

<p>The "View Log" button will, by default, display the log file that is
 currently being written.  In general, it will display the same log data
 as all of the other log windows you will find available in the supplicant.
 However, if full debug logging is enabled, the normal log windows will NOT
 display the extra debug information, but this log file view will. <b><i>NOTE:
 </i></b> The log file that is displayed through this button is a snapshot
 in time of the log file.  As new log lines are added to the file they will not
 be added to this window.  You will need to close, and reopen the window in
 order to get an updated snapshot of the log file.</p>

<p>The "Include Friendly Warnings" check box enables messages to be written
to the log file that don't necessarily indicate that there is a problem with
the supplicant.  These warnings include things such as a warning when a WEP
key has been in use long enough that it could have been compromised by an
outside attack.  In general, these friendly warnings add very little to the
size of a log file, and should be left enabled.</p>

<p>The "Roll Logs by Size" option changes how logs are stored on disk.  If this
option is unchecked a log file will be created each time the supplicant service
is started, and all log messages will be written to it until the supplicant
service terminates.  If you run the supplicant for long stretches of time, or in
a verbose or debug mode, the log files can grow rather large.  If this box
is checked, then you can use the "Log Size to Roll Files at" setting to
determine how large log files should be allowed to get.  <b><i>NOTE :</b></i>
The size specified in the "Log Size to Roll Files at" is a boundry case.  It
does not mean that the logs will be rolled at exactly that size.  To avoid
disk thrashing, the log file size is checked once a minute.  If the log file
exceeds the size specified, it is rolled.</p>

<p>The "Number of Logs to Keep" specifies the number of old logs that the
supplicant should keep around.  There are two ways that a log file can be
generated.  One is on startup of the supplicant engine.  Any existing log
files will be rolled, and a fresh one started.  The second way is for the
log size limit specified by "Roll Logs by Size" to be exceeded.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupadvanced" id="xsupadvanced"></a>Advanced Panel</h2>
<p>The Advanced panels contain settings that should only be used by more
advanced users.  Unless you have a solid understanding of 802.1X you should
probably avoid changing any of the advanced settings, since the defaults
are valid for most users.</p>






<h2><a name="xsupsettings" id="xsupsettings"></a>Advanced Settings Panel</h2>
<p>The Advanced Settings panel contains various settings that can be used
to manipulate the behavior of certain supplicant components.  These settings
have less of a major impact on the operation of the supplicant, so a
moderately advanced user should be able to change them without getting the
supplicant in to a non-functional state.</p>

<p>The 'Scan Timeout' setting is the amount of time that a wireless interface
is allowed to complete a scan for wireless networks.  If the scan timeout value
is exceeded, the supplicant will notify the user that a scan has failed, and
try again later.</p>

<p>The 'Association Timeout' is the amount of time that the supplicant waits
before assuming that a wireless interface will be unable to associate to a
network.  Setting this to a lower value may increase the ability of the
supplicant to recover from failed associations.  However, if the timer is
set too low, the supplicant many not be able to complete an association.</p>

<p>The 'Wired Default' setting allows the user to select a default wired
authentication to use when the supplicant initially starts up.  Since a
connection has a binding to an interface, the selection of the connection to
use also designates the interface that will be used.  This setting can be used
in conjunction with a stored username and password to create an auto login to
a wired network.</p>

<p>The 'Run Other Supplicant Check on Startup' setting specifies if the UI
should spawn a process to check for the existance of other supplicants and
wireless managers.  The process that is run is the same process that is used
during the installation.  If other supplicants or wireless managers are
discovered, then detection tool will allow you to attempt to disable the
other programs that could cause issues.  Turning off this check is only
suggested if understand that installing new interfaces may result in the
supplicant not being able to perform properly.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupinternals" id="xsupinternals"></a>Advanced Internals Panel</h2>
<p>The Advanced Internals panel contains timer settings that modify the
behavior of the supplicant.  These settings should only be modified by
advanced users that understand how changing these timers will impact the
operation of the supplicant.</p>

<p>The 'Auth Period' timer is the amount of time that the supplicant will wait,
during an authentication, before assuming that the authentication has timed out.</p>

<p>The 'Held Period' timer is the amount of time that the supplicant will wait
after a failed authentication before attempting to start a new authentication.
 NOTE: Modifying this timer won't allow you to authenticate any faster.  There
 is also a held timer on the authenticator that will prevent you from authenticating
 any faster than the network allows!</p>

<p>The 'Idle Period' is the amount of time that the state machine waits before
retransmitting an EAP message.</p>

<p>The 'Stale WEP Key Timeout' is the amount of time that a dynamic WEP key should
be in use before the supplicant warns the user that the key could have been cracked.
 NOTE: This timer has no functional impact on the operation of the supplicant.
 The Stale WEP key warning is a 'Friendly' message that is only there to help
 the user understand the insecurity of using WEP based networks.</p>

<p>The 'Maximum Starts' counter is the number of EAPoL-Starts the supplicant
should send before it assumes the authenticator doesn't speak 802.1X.  Once
this number of starts has been sent, the connection will default to
authenticated state.</p>





<h2><a name="xsupissues" id="xsupissues"></a>Known Issues</h2>
<p>The following are issues that people have run in to with XSupplicant :</p>
<p>1. The priority settings only have meaning on boot up.  Once you have told
 the supplicant to connect to a specific wireless network it will continue to
 try to maintain a connection to the network until the user tells it to do
 otherwise.</p>

<p>2. Priority settings have no control over which interface the OS uses to
 send traffic out.  They are only useful for determining with wireless
 network to automatically connect to at boot up.</p>

<p>3. Changing the log level without having a log directory defined doesn't result
 in the higher log level messages being displayed in the UI's log window.  You
 can work around this by defining a value log directory and pressing the Save
 button.  This will result in a log file being written, and the log level in
 the UI's log window to be changed.</p>
